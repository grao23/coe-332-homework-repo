This is the README for the Homework01 to show the workings for the files which I am submitting 


File1: ml_json_converter

The goal in this file is to show how Meteorite_Landings.json could be converted into cxv, xml, and 
yaml files. We first read in the .json file and then opened a new file which would contain the data
as a csv, xml and yaml files types. 



File2: ml_json_reader

The goal of this file is to read the Meteorite_Landings.json file and print out some summary 
statistics related to the file. In the file there are 3 main functions each designed to print out a summary statitic. 
The computeaveragemass function takes in a list of dictionaries and key strings to out the average mass of all the meteorites. The second function is the check hemisphere function in which we use the latitude and longtitude in the dataset to distinguish which region it comes from and then print out the north/ south and the east/west location of it. 
The final function is used to count the different meterorite classes and output them as how many meteorites are there.
